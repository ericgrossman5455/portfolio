		Mobell aims to make society more inclusive to people with disabilities and, as a result, make
		greater independence accessible to all. This service suite for businesses and their customers was
		conceived during the 2019 Camp PolyHacks Hackathon, winning 1st Place and “Best Use of Satellite
		Technology by&nbsp;Northrop&nbsp;Grumman”.

		Driven by a pursuit of constant improvement, my team and I were tasked with identifying
		inefficiencies to streamline BoltAbout&rsquo;s internal processes. This work utilized Lean/Six
		Sigma and UX Design methodologies to implement changes that not only drastically improve the
		employee experience, but also continue to save the&nbsp;company&nbsp;money.

		The goal for this project was to re-envision Cal Poly&rsquo;s brand in an authentic and modern
		way by incorporating Material Design language in conjunction with user research and Cal Poly’s
		branding guidelines. This work and its associated insights were later used for inspiration by the
		Cal Poly app design team for development of their redesigned student&nbsp;application.
